# Yaghmood Feedback Sentiment & Relevance Classifier

This project is an experimental chatbot designed to analyze customer feedback, determine the sentiment, check whether the complaint is relevant to the agency’s context, and optionally generate a short and polite response. It combines multiple AI models (sentiment classifier, language detector, translator, and a Mistral-7B assistant) to create a complete multi-step triage pipeline.

> **Important:**  
> All “agency context” logic is purely experimental and **does not reflect any real business decisions, operations, or the actual Yaghmood company**.  
> This project is intended for research, prototyping, and AI behavior testing only.

## Highlights

- Automatic sentiment detection using a robust multi-class classifier  
- Automatic language detection & translation to English for multilingual feedback  
- Context-aware relevance judgment using a Mistral 7B GPTQ model  
- Fully customizable system prompt (edit `utils/system_promt.txt` to change assistant behavior instantly)  
- End-to-end chatbot pipeline combining sentiment, relevance, and apology generation  
- GPU-accelerated inference (recommended: **6GB VRAM or more**)  
- Simple Streamlit UI for testing and demonstration

## Models Used

All models run on GPU:

| Model Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `tabularisai/robust-sentiment-analysis` | Classification | Classifies sentiment into 5 categories |
| `facebook/nllb-200-1.3B` | Seq2Seq | Translates any supported language to English |
| `papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection` | Classification | Detects input language |
| `RedHatAI/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-GPTQ-4bit` | GPTQ | Determines relevance & generates responses |

## Installation

It’s recommended to use a dedicated environment (conda or Python venv).

### 1. Create a virtual environment (example with conda)

```
conda create -n env_name python=3.10
conda activate env_name
```
### 2. Install all dependencies
From the project root:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

After installing dependencies, launch the interface with:

```
streamlit run interface.py
```

A web application will open where you can input user feedback.
The system will then:

1. Detect language

2. Translate if necessary (refer to the doccumentation to know the supported languages)

3. Analyze sentiment

4. Check contextual relevance

5. Output either:
    - irrelevant, or
    - a short apology message


## Examples
Example 1 — Relevant & Negative:
i am very angry the flight to sweden from france at 8am was delayed by 2 hours and the hotel is now full while i already booked 2 days!

Expected:
A short apology response with contact instructions.

Example 2 — Negative but Irrelevant (cars):
i hate this agency so much i cant even find cars to rent

Expected:
irrelevant

Example 3 — Positive using French language:
